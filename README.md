# ABBY-IOX-Co-Processor !(/Photos/IOX_TOP_VIEW.png)
Low cost, high speed I/O co-processor module expands the capability and functionality of popular MicroProcessors and MicroControllers. 
The IOX module greatly enhances microprocessor I/O capability by using one of three high speed serial buses (I2C, UART, and SPI) to access up to 20 independent GPIO's with important features such as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) outputs, digital frequency measurement inputs, external input event detection, rotary encoder support, fast analog to digital conversion, etc.

## List of Features
- I2C serial bus option supports up to 1 Mbit/s.
- UART serial bus supports baud rates up to 6 Mbits/s.
- 4 wire SPI with clock rate up to 18 Mbits/s in both half and full duplex operation.
- Up to 20 independent GPIO pins (18 for SPI), configurable as Digital Input, Analog Input, or Output.
- 16 inputs are capable of edge detection (rising, falling, or both). Inputs can also have pull-up or pull-down resistors.
- Outputs can be either push-pull or open-drain type with programmable current drive and optionally pull-up or pull-down resistors.
- Up to 10 PWM outputs.
- Up to 10 digital frequency measurement inputs.
- Up to 4 event notification outputs.
- 12 bit fast ADC with up to 10 multiplexed inputs. Background conversion of multiple channels with up to 65535 samples.
- Support for up to 8 rotary encoders.
- Digital and I/O operation from 2.5V to 3.6V. NOTE: Module is NOT 5V tolerant on VCC or I/O pins.
- Sleep mode with programmable wake up methods.
- Companion C++ library for use with Arduino, platformIO, or other development environments.
- Optional breakout board with pogo pin socket for development and gang programming.
