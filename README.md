# ABBY-IOX
Low cost high speed I/O co-processor module expands the capability and functionality of popular MicroProcessors and MicroControllers. 
The IOX module greatly enhances microprocessor I/O capability by using one of three high speed serial buses (I2C, UART, and SPI) to access up to 20 independent GPIO's with advanced features such as PWM, digital frequency measurement, external event detection, rotary encoder support, fast analog to digital conversion, and more.
## List of Features
- I2C serial bus option with up to 1 Mbit rate supported.
- UART serial bus supports baud rates up to 
- Up to 20 independent GPIO pins, configurable as Digital Input, Analog Input, or Output.
- 16 inputs are capable of edge detection (rising, falling, or both). Inputs can also have pull-up or pull-down resistors.
- Outputs can be either push-pull or open-drain type with programmable current drive and optionally pull-up or pull-down resistors.
- Up to 10 PWM outputs.
- Up to 10 digital frequency measurement inputs.
- Up to 4 event notification outputs.
- 12 bit fast ADC with up to 10 multiplexed inputs. Background conversion of multiple channels with up to 65535 samples.
- Support for up to 8 rotary encoders.
- Digital and I/O operation from 2.5V to 3.6V.
- Sleep mode with programmable wake up methods.
- Companion C++ library for use with Arduino, platformIO, or other development environments.
- Optional breakout board with pogo pin socket for development and gang programming.
